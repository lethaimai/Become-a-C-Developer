# Searching Data Algorithms
## 1. List of lessons
- Unordered list search

- Ordered list seach: searching data on an sorted list is much more efficient

- Determine if a list is sorted



### 1.1. Searching an Ordered List.

- With a sorted list, we can perform a tyoe of search named **Binary Search**.

- Let's image that we are searching for a number 41 in a sorted list:

- To perform a bynary srearch, we start with 2 indexes: at the beginning and end of the list.
