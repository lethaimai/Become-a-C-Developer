# Searching Data Algorithms
## 1. List of lessons
- Unordered list search

- Ordered list seach: searching data on an sorted list is much more efficient

- Determine if a list is sorted



### 1.1. Searching an Ordered List.

- With a sorted list, we can perform a tyoe of search named **Binary Search**.

- Let's image that we are searching for a number 41 in a sorted list:

- To perform a bynary srearch, we start with 2 indexes: at the beginning and end of the list.

- To see how the algorithm **Binary Search** works, check out this link:

### 1.2. Searching max value recursively

- With the function ***findMax***

- Assuming you have an array Vector A= {25, 12, 7, 38, 4}. The recursive algorithm will be explained in the figure below:
