- The data member from the class follows the keyword private, so it can be accessed from within the class, but not from outside

**2. Functions are public, Data is private**

Usually the data within a class is private and the functions are public. This is a result of the way 
classes are used. The data is hidden so it will be safe from accidental manipulation, while the functions that operate 
on the data are public so they can be accessed from outside the class. However, there is no rule that says data must be 
private and functions public; in some circumstances you may find youâ€™ll need to use private functions and public data.
